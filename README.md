# gbcmobihelp.github.io

Basic HTML page with JS to generate the time and date

## To Do:
### High Priority:
 - Make webscraper to scrape the Mobihelp site to list the tutors of the current sessions

### Low Priority:
 - Make the textbox containing the course list "edittable"
   - Planning to just use vanilla js to create some kind of event watcher
